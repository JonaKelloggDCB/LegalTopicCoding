Welcome to the GitHub repository for my project on disjointed legislation, titled “Frankenstein’s Bill: The Political Utility of Disjointed Legislation.”

This project aims to identify and analyze provisions within legislation that are unrelated to a bill’s stated purpose, 
with a particular focus on how policymakers use such provisions to create strategic ambiguity. 
By examining these strategic choices, the project sheds light on how disjointed legislation can serve political and policy goals.

The accompanying code is designed to be adaptable to different legislative contexts, provided the underlying data are appropriately prepared. 
If you use the dataset or code for your own research or related projects, please feel free to reach out with questions or to share any interesting findings.

All code is available in this GitHub repository, and the final dataset used in the project can be found here:

The analysis relies on a newly constructed dataset that integrates three large-
scale legislative corpora from the United States, the European Union, and
France. Specifically, the dataset merges materials introduced by Kornilova
and Eidelman (2019), Laurer and Borrett (2020), and Harvard Library Innovation Lab (2024), respectively.
